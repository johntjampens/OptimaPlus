# OptimaPlus

The project initially started as a test labo for my school, but when i was thinking about it, why don't i expand the labo
to a real world project?

Optima : stands for great Open Source software without expensive licensing costs.
Plus : stands for excelling the great Open Source software thats high available, failsafe ....

A project where i want to build a SOHO ready network with only open source tools, that can withstand outages,
server issues etc and provide the highest availability possible.

What does a real SOHO Business need?
